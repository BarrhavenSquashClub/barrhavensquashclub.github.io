            <h3>About the House League</h2>
              <p>We have more than 50 house league players, ranging from beginners to advanced levels. Barrhaven Squash
                club
                facilitates matching players based on previous months results - players are responsible for scheduling
                matches against others</p>
              <br>

              <h3>Scheduling Process</h2>
                <p>At the beginning of each month, house ladder rankings are emailed based on the previous month's
                  matches,
                  along with an updated membership list. Players are grouped into a "house" with 4 or 5 other players.
                </p>
                <p>For house league matches, you only contact players within your house and enter scores based on the
                  results. For example, someone in House B will play matches with others in House B.</p>
                <p>To set up a match, look up a player's email and schedule a game before the month ends. Record your
                  scores
                  on the Club's notice board next to court 2.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Match Rules</h3>
                <div class="container">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Winning all your matches moves you up the ladder; losing all moves you down.</li>
                    <li>Each game is played to 11 or 15 points (players may decide) and must be won by 2 points.</li>
                    <li>The first player to win 3 games is the match winner.</li>
                    <li>Friendly games with other club players can be arranged throughout the month.</li>
                    <li>Most players use a double yellow dot ball for house league matches.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <br>
                <h3>Facilities</h3>
                <p>There are 4 courts available at Walter Baker Sports Center that can be booked through <a
                    href="https://reservation.frontdesksuite.ca/rcfs/walterbaker/Home/Index?Culture=en&PageId=0c5c451b-cbab-42ac-8298-69a4817c5bcc&ShouldStartReserveTimeFlow=False&ButtonId=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Safety</h3>
                <p><em>Club strongly recommends using eye protection!</em> </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Expectations</h3>
                <p>You need to play at least one match per month to remain in the house league. If you cannot play
                  even
                  once, but want to remain in the league, please contact me to discuss accommodations.</p>
                <p>However, if missing matches becomes a habit, you may be asked to leave the league until you can
                  play
                  regularly. One match per month keeps you in the league, but winning just one match may cause you to
                  drop a
                  house. To remain at your current level, winning at least two matches is typically needed, and
                  winning
                  at
                  least three usually results in moving up.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Opponent Cancellations & No-Shows</h3>
                <p>Sometimes, players try to schedule matches but their opponents cancel last-minute or fail to show
                  up.
                  If
                  this happens, please inform league admins.</p>
                <div class="container">
                  <ul>
                    <li>If your opponent does not show up, record a 3-0 score on the sheet and note that they
                      defaulted.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the match can be rescheduled later that month, please do so.</li>
                    <li>Do not unilaterally enter scores without playing a match.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <br>
                <p>If you made a good-faith effort to contact your opponent and they did not respond or canceled,
                  email
                  me.
                  I will try to take this into account.</p>
                <p>Honesty is expectedâ€”this league is about fair competition and enjoyment.</p>
